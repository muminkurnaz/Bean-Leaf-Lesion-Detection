# Bean-Leaf-Lesion-Detection
This repository contains a comprehensive study on detecting bean leaf lesions using advanced image processing techniques. The project aims to accurately identify and classify lesions on bean leaves through various image processing methods.


## Project Description

In this project, we utilize several image processing techniques to analyze and detect lesions on bean leaves. The following techniques were used:

1. **Grayscale Conversion**: Converting the image to grayscale.
2. **Resizing**: Adjusting the image dimensions for consistency.
3. **Thresholding**: Applying binary thresholding to highlight lesions.
4. **Vertical Flip**: Flipping the image vertically.
5. **Histogram Equalization**: Improving the contrast of the image.
6. **Histogram Plotting**: Generating histogram plots for image analysis.
7. **Salt and Pepper Noise**: Adding noise to the image for robustness testing.
8. **Median Blur**: Applying median blurring to reduce noise.
9. **Gaussian Blur**: Using Gaussian blurring for smoothing the image.
10. **Mean Filter**: Applying mean filtering for noise reduction.
11. **Sobel Edge Detection**: Detecting edges using the Sobel operator.
12. **Canny Edge Detection**: Detecting edges using the Canny algorithm.
13. **Laplacian Edge Detection**: Detecting edges using the Laplacian operator.
